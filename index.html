            <p>
                Two years ago, a heart quietly reached for another—not with grand gestures, not with fireworks (though she is hot enough to cause explosions)—but with something far rarer: intention. It wasn’t love at first sight, though she did look criminally good that day and every other one. No, it was slower. More real. The kind of love that sneaks up on you with soft hands and stays with stubborn loyalty.
                He didn’t fall for her in one single magical moment. He fell a little more every time she laughed at his dumb jokes—even the ones that didn’t deserve laughter(And we know I had some pretty dumb ones). He fell a little deeper each time she hyped him up when he felt like quitting, whispering, “You’ve got this,” with the kind of conviction that made him believe it too. In a world full of chaos, she became his peace. His person. His home.
                Back then, love was thrilling, new, and a little terrifying. It meant staying up too late, talking about everything and nothing. It meant looking at each other and knowing, without words, “Yeah… I’m screwed in the best possible way.”
                But love grew. It grew beyond butterflies and sweet messages.
                It became:
                •	Long voice notes sent during busy days (and the occasional panic when she left him on read for two hours but instead she had a big ass nap)
                •	Matching moods without even planning it (scary, honestly)
                •	Fighting over where to eat—then settling on her favorite (because obviously, she’s always right)
                •	Him pretending not to know what to get her and still surprises her,  (and still gets his cover blown  40% of the time)
                It became choosing each other even on days without sparks or poems—on the days that just looked like surviving. It became the quiet confidence that no matter what storms came, they'd face them hand in hand (or at least while arguing about who’s more dramatic).
                She wasn’t just the pretty girl who stole his heart. She was—and still is:
                •	His muse
                •	His personal therapist
                •	His “Did you work out today?” reminder
                •	His soft place to land, even when life is throwing bricks instead of flowers
                When he doubted himself, she didn’t just offer words—she believed in him like her life depended on it. When he succeeded, her joy lit up the room brighter than his own pride. Because in her eyes, his wins are hers too. (Even if she did say “I told you so” at least once.) (He was more right but shhhhh)
                He still remembers the first time he looked at her and thought, “This is it. This is love. This is mine.” And two years later, that feeling? It hasn’t just stayed. It’s grown teeth, roots, and wings. It’s more real now, stronger. Not because it was always easy—but because they kept choosing each other, again and again.
                Through:
                •	Laughter that filled empty rooms
                •	Arguments that ended in hugs, forehead kisses, and “I’m sorry, I was being a bit much” (on both sides)
                •	Come out for 5-minutes that turned into hour long walks.
                •	Days that dragged and nights that ended too soon
                •	Dreaming of a future with nap dates, shared grocery runs, a kid or two who’s probably way too smart for their own good, and the same inside jokes that never seem to get old
                She is his warmth in winter, his courage when he doubts, his softness when the world turns hard. And when he imagines growing old, he doesn’t fear it—not with her hand still holding his.
                So now, two years into forever, there’s something he needs her to know:
                You are not just the love of my life. You are my life.
                Thank you for choosing me—again, and again, and again.
                Thank you for seeing me when I couldn’t see myself.
                For loving me in all my versions—yes, even the grumpy, sleepy, overthinking ones.
                Here’s to:
                •	More years of “where should we eat?”
                •	More dramatic storytelling about our day like we’re in a soap opera
                •	More spontaneous slow dances in the middle of the street
                •	More late-night “what if” dreams that become real, step by step
                Here’s to everything we’ve been.
                And to all the “us” we’ve yet to become.
                I don’t just love you—I believe in us. Fiercely. Forever.
